### Notes On Distributed Ledgers and Blockchain Consensus Algorithms

*Written for Kyle and Alex*

Recommended Reads / Books:

* [Blockchain Basics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Blockchain-Basics-Non-Technical-Introduction-Steps/dp/1484226038/ref=asc_df_1484226038/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=311013355418&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6909065002431090852&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=20343&hvtargid=pla-315913527774&psc=1&th=1&psc=1) - Introduces you to a generic blockchain data structure, what a consensus algorithm is, how consensus is reached, security vulnerabilities in first generation blockchains, introduction to Proof of Work, loads of information on SHA_256, basically a great read for a semi-technical (but not too technical) introduction to distributed ledgers and how they're updated using network consensus protocols.
* Most of the other reading that I have done on Blockchains has been through simply reading documentation.
* However, if you're going to develop DApps on Cardano, then you're going to want to check out: [learnyouahaskellforgreatgood](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) - these Haskell programmers are really smart, but this will likely look like very strange looking code to you for about three weeks, then you get pretty accustomed to reading it, then after about six weeks, you'll probably be able to write it well enough (Monads, Template Haskell, Monoids, Short Hand Operations, etc). The book is free to read online, so that's always nice.

Developing For Cardano:

* Check out Cardanos Website, check the docs, the roadmap, etc.
* Check out IOHK (I believe it's Cardanos 'parent' company? Either way, it's the research arm of the entire project, they've got like > 115 published papers in peer reviewed journals, etc).
* On my GitHub, you'll find LOADS of introductory documentation too, and a LOAD of papers.
* Check out Lars lecture series to get started programming basic Plutus (basically Haskell) for Cardano: It comes under [Plutus Pioneer Program](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAwSpbpQDDzEDRQqcDH8Iw)

*I'll add more documentation & links to this when I get time, been really busy these last few weeks... Drop me a message sometime on Facebook to let me know when you're both available to catch up.*
